Personal project 4 for Code Institue Full-Stack Development program. This project is a Full Stack website built using the Django Framework. 

Pauls Kitchen is a blog style website where users can look at the recipes that were posted on the site.

Users can comment on recipes and also like recipes that they like. Users have a profile page that shows all the recipes that a user has posted and liked.

### Design

For the desgin i leaned into the name of the site. Paul's Kitchen. Paul's Kitchen so essentially my kitchen. I wanted to make it an extenstion of myself.

So thats why i kept the design mininal. Black font against white background. As if the recipes are written on a type of white board with black marker.

Black footer with white writing for contrast against the body.

Hero-Image I choose a laptop in a kitchen. I thought it works well with the theme.
