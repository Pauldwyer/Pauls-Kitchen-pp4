# Pauls Kitchen - Introduction

Personal project 4 for Code Institue Full-Stack Development program. This project is a Full Stack website built using the Django Framework. 

Pauls Kitchen is a blog style website where users can look at the recipes that were posted on the site. 
Users can create an account and post recipes that they would like to share. 
Users can comment on recipes and also like recipes that they like. Users have a profile page that shows all the recipes that a user has posted and liked.

## UX

### User Stories

## Design

For the desgin i leaned into the name of the site. Paul's Kitchen. Paul's Kitchen so essentially my kitchen. I wanted to make it an extenstion of myself.

So thats why i kept the design mininal. Black font against white background. As if the recipes are written on a type of white board with black marker.

Black footer with white writing for contrast against the body.

Font for headings i went with [Permenant Marker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker?query=Marker)
Font for all other text i used [Rowdies](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rowdies?query=rowdies)

Hero-Image I choose a laptop in a kitchen. I thought it works well with the theme.
